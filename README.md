## Working With Remotes
1) Remote repository is an online repository that can be pushed by anyone who has access to the repository
2) git clone to get the remote repository on your computer
3) git commit stages teh changes along with a message
4) git push puts the modificated code into the remote repository
5) Cloning the repository makes an automatic folder in the File Manager


## Working Locally
1) Cloning the repository creates a local copy
2) Changes are done locally, then pushing gets does the changes to the remote copy 
3) If push fails, resolve merge issues then push
4) You can create different branches in a project
5) git log --oneline is useful to see the commits that were made
